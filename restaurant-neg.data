Text = "I sat down with my plate and bit into a raw chicken liver and blood gushed out of my mouth. It sickened me and my family who saw this. I told the waitress who was concerned and she told the manager "Jeff" who sat eating his dinner three tables over. We waited for him to finish up and come over but finally decided that he didn't intend to. We got up to the register where we promptly asked for a refund and he finally came up there. He said that he would refund my part but not the rest of the group, because we had been there thirty min. I said yes waiting for you to handle this. Even my small daughter told him they didn't eat off their plate after that. He was rude and unconcerned. We left disgusted."
