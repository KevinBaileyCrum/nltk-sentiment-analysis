Text = "Outstanding. This trip we ate at a number of the award winning establishments in the islands and my wife and I absolutely agree that this was easily the best meal of the two week visit. The Opakapaka and Ahi were superbly done, sauces outstanding. Appetizer was a meal itself - well prepared and interesting both for the palette and eye. Wine suggestion was perfectly matched compliment to the entrees, and there has never been any doubt in my wife's mind that the Chocolate Souffle is the best in the Islands. Do not miss this. Would HIGHLY recommend, and return with anticipation."

Text = "I sat down with my plate and bit into a raw chicken liver and blood gushed out of my mouth. It sickened me and my family who saw this. I told the waitress who was concerned and she told the manager "Jeff" who sat eating his dinner three tables over. We waited for him to finish up and come over but finally decided that he didn't intend to. We got up to the register where we promptly asked for a refund and he finally came up there. He said that he would refund my part but not the rest of the group, because we had been there thirty min. I said yes waiting for you to handle this. Even my small daughter told him they didn't eat off their plate after that. He was rude and unconcerned. We left disgusted."
