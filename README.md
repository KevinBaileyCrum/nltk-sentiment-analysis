# nltk-sentiment-analysis
A natural language processing probabilistic model for processing natural languages, namely in sentiment analysis in restaurant reviews.  We train a Naive Bayes classifier to automatically label unseen reviews as positive or negative. 

## features_vectors.py
features_vectors.py is the main program.  
It requires an additional filename be presented in order to process the feature vector for that file.
If a file is not present, the program prompts the user for correct input and then exits.

USAGE: $ features_vectors.py [filename_in_directory_to_be_processed]

features_vectors.py calls data_helper.py for parsing through the data to obtain overall review score and the text
of the review

### note on runtime
features_vectors.py takes a long time to run and most of time is spent in the gathering of the ngrams.
I am attatching the files that were generated by the code to save the grader time but if they must
be run know it will take about 30 minutes.  

The code has print statements to know that it is not frozen and is working though the ngrams.
Im not entirely sure why it is so slow, I am probably calling something in an ineffecient way
that I am not aware of.
