Text = "Outstanding. This trip we ate at a number of the award winning establishments in the islands and my wife and I
 absolutely agree that this was easily the best meal of the two week visit. The Opakapaka and Ahi were superbly done, 
sauces outstanding. Appetizer was a meal itself - well prepared and interesting both for the palette and eye. Wine sug
gestion was perfectly matched compliment to the entrees, and there has never been any doubt in my wife's mind that the
 Chocolate Souffle is the best in the Islands. Do not miss this. Would HIGHLY recommend, and return with anticipation.
